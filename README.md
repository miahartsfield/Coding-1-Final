 My website is about Traveling and my love for it. In this website I wanted to express my love for it. I wanted to give my views a feel for traveling and what is the expersenses you can have with it. In this wesite I put a little bit about me and what I enjoy doing. The website has a carasuel, a a menu, contact page, an about me page, a footer with a live link repsoitory, and links that go back in forth from the different pages. I enjoyed making this website. This class has helped me learn so much about coding and computers. I have enjoyed it alot.
